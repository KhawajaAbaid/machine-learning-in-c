# Machine Learning in C
Implementations of popular machine learning architectures from scratch in c!

## Purpose/Motivation
I'm learning backpropagation and underlying concepts of deep learning myself using Michael Nielsen's absolutely incredible book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) and I want to share my journey with fellow curious learners who are intrigued by the fundamentals of deep learning and want to do it from sctrach!

Therefore, I strongly recommend you to first read the first 2 chapters of this book if you currently know nothing about backpropgation and then try using this code as your starting point. I also recommend starting with `linear_regression.c` as its the simplest.

Also if you (like me) need visual learning assistance, please checkout 3blue1brown's [Neural Networks YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi). It works as a great supplemantry to the above mentioned book.


## Disclaimer:
I'm no c expert, not even mediocre, so please don't expect any high quaity code. I'm also a student of machine learning so you may find flaws in my logic. Please feel free to contribute, point out any mistakes, and propose imporvement and recommendations. I'd love them!

## Usage:
Currently, I've included a very basic make file, so using it you can compile a given architecture as follows:
```
make mlp
```
The currently available architecture names are as follow:
1. linear_regression
2. logistic_regression
3. mlp


I'm working on building more advanced architectures from sctrach. So stay tuned! ðŸ‘€
